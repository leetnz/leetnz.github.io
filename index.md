# About

Hey, Hoani here.

I have a pretty strange work history spanning from blockchain software through to rocket avoinic systems.

Leet is my consulting company which I have estabished to start helping companies with thier technical challenges on demand.

I pride myself in keeping up to date with engineering best practices and using cross-disciplinary approaches to deliver high-quality solutions.

### Design Approaches

#### Inspired by Agile and Software Productivity Research

A focus on reducing defects and saving time by conforming to popular style guidelines, linting, test driven development and CI/CD.

#### Practical Industry-based Experience

Full design lifecycle services from prototype through to optimization for deployment/manufacturing.

#### Leveraging Really Hard Maths (a.k.a algebra and calculus)

Using simulation and control theory to develop products faster and better.
